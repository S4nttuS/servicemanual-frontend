# servicemanual-frontend

Done as a pretask for Netum on spring 2020

This application adds a frontend to a backend project [servicemanual-java](https://github.com/S4nttuS/Servicemanual-java/tree/master/servicemanual-java), which is for keeping records of maintenance jobs for factory devices. Application supports all functionalities that the backend includes.
